npm run dev
```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### MongoDB Setup

The application expects a MongoDB database named `d79-crawls` with the following collections:

#### Collections

1. **registrations** - Legacy registration data
2. **events** - Event information and details
3. **eventLocations** - Specific location details for events
4. **eventRegistrations** - New registration system (future use)

#### Database Schema

**Registration Schema:**
```typescript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  email: string,           // Must end with @schools.nyc.gov
  firstName: string,
  lastName: string,
  school: string,
  crawlDate: 'tuesday' | 'thursday',
  crawlLocation: string,
  createdAt: Date
}
```

**Event Schema:**
```typescript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  title: string,
  date: string,            // ISO date string
  time: string,            // e.g., "10:00 AM - 12:00 PM"
  eventType: 'virtual' | 'site-crawl',
  locationIds: ObjectId[], // References to eventLocations
  description: string,
  targetAudience: 'nycps-staff' | 'community' | 'both',
  maxCapacity: number,
  isActive: boolean,
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

**Event Location Schema:**
```typescript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  name: string,
  address: string,
  borough: string,
  capacity: number,
  description: string,
  coordinates: {
    lat: number,
    lng: number
  }
}
```

### Seeding the Database

To populate the database with event locations and details, run:

```bash
node scripts/seed-database.js
```

This will create:
- 5 event locations (Manhattan, Queens, Bronx, Staten Island, Brooklyn)
- 2 events (Tuesday and Thursday crawls)
- Proper relationships between events and locations
